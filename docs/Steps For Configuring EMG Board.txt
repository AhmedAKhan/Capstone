Steps For Configuring EMG Board

NOTE: Orientation of the board should be so the word "Wiser" is right side up

Update WiFi chip code:
- Open "ESP8622_offline" in Arduino IDE
- Change the SSID, Password, Static IP and Gateway to correct values in "ESP8622_offline" file
- Plug in the power for the board
- Connect the black, orange, yellow cable to computer
	- On the board, the cable connects to the 3 pins right above the WiFi chip card. Labelled "GNU", "RX", "TX"
	- Pin order starting from the left: Black, Orange, Yellow
- Open Tools > Serial Monitor
- Notice the text reads "...boot mode: (3,0)..."
- In order to update the code on the WiFi chip, the Boot Mode has to be (1,6)
	- Locate the two push buttons at the bottom of the board
	- Press them in this order: Left, Right
	- After about 1 second, release them in this order: Right, Left
	- Notice in the Serial Monitor, the text "...boot mode: (1,6)..."
- IMPORTANT: Remove the jumper from the two pins right beside the green LED
- Upload the code from Arduino IDE
- Once code is successfully updated, test if the board is connected to WiFi by "ping <static IP>" in command line
- Put the jumper back on the 2 pins beside the green LED
